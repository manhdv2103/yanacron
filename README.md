# yanacron (Yet Another aNACRON)

yanacron is an anacron clone in Haskell. Honestly, it's nothing special. I created yanacron just because some time ago I had trouble when setting up my anacron, but instead of searching for a solution on StackOverflow, I decided to recreate anacron with my newly learned language at that time - Haskell. So don't use it seriously. Just use anacron instead.

## Inspiration

I get a lot of inspiration (and code) from this [cronie's anacron](https://github.com/cronie-crond/cronie/tree/master/anacron) implementation.

## TODO

- Read and use environment variables from yanacrontab file.
- Better output.
- Add more functions described in [anacron manpage](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/anacron.8.html).
- Logging.
